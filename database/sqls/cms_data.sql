Non-Commercial Use</h2>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<h3 id="trm-10-1">10.1. Personal Use</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The Licensed Contents, reports, and other content material on the Website/Software are intended for personal, non-commercial use only. Without limiting the foregoing, and notwithstanding the terms of any Alternate License for such Licensed Content, Reports, may not be used, distributed or otherwise exploited for any commercial purpose, commercial advantage or private monetary compensation, unless prior agreed in writing by WITSYNC.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<h3 id="trm-10-2">10.2. Impermissible Uses</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the following are types of uses that WITSYNC expressly defines as falling outside of &ldquo;non-commercial&rdquo; use:</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n	<li>the sale or rental of (1) any part of the Licensed Content, Reports generated, (2) any derivative works based at least in part on the Licensed Content, Reports or (3) any collective work that includes any part of the Licensed Content or Reports;</li>\r\n	<li>providing training, support, or editorial services that use or reference the Licensed Content or Report in exchange for a fee; and</li>\r\n	<li>the sale of advertisements, sponsorships, or promotions placed on the Licensed Content, or any part thereof, or the sale of advertisements, sponsorships, or promotions on any website or blog containing any part of the Licensed Material, including without limitation any &ldquo;pop-up advertisements&rdquo;.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<h3 id="trm-10-3">10.3. Use Characterization</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Whether a particular use of the Licensed Content or Reports is &ldquo;non-commercial&rdquo; depends on the use, not the user. Thus, a use of the Licensed Content that does not require that users pay fees and that does not provide an entity with a commercial advantage is &ldquo;non-commercial,&rdquo; even if this use is by a commercial entity. Conversely, any use that involves charging users in connection with their access to the Licensed Content is not &ldquo;non-commercial,&rdquo; even if this use is by a non-profit entity. As an example, a for-profit corporation&rsquo;s use of the Licensed Educational Content for internal professional development or training of employees is permitted, so long as the corporation charges no fees, directly or indirectly, for such use. Conversely, as another example, a non-profit entity&rsquo;s use of the Licensed Content in connection with a fee-based training or educational program is NOT &ldquo;non-commercial&rdquo; and is not permitted.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<h3 id="trm-10-4">10.4.
